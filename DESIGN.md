# TheEditor - Design for v-alpha-0

This is the first "functional" milestone of TheEditor.  It involves:

* having an editor. this simply holds the content of the current document, and the ability to edit it; for now, will will only implement a left-right-arrow-controlled cursor with backspace and regular typing
* save/load for files
* a file finder menu that searches for any file in the source tree like ctrl-p in vscode

Thus TheEditor, in terms of bare-bones requirements, will be complete.
